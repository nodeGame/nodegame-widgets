# nodegame-widgets

Collections of useful and reusable javascript / HTML code snippets for nodegame-window.

## Usage: node.widgets.append

Loading a widget from a nodeGame game is very easy:

```js

	var options = {};
	var root = W.getElementById('myRoot');

	var wall = node.widgets.append('Wall', root, options);

	// or

	var wall = node.widgets.get('Wall', options);

	// some operations

	wall.append(root);

	// or

	var myCustomWidget = new myCustomWidgets(options);
	node.widgets.append(myCustomWidget, root);

```

### First parameter: Widget object or string

This can be either a string representation of one the widgets objects already inside the node.widgets.widgets collections or a new object. In the latter case, the widget is added to the collection (if valid).

### Second parameter: Root element

This parameter is later passed to the ```append``` method of the widget. If no root element was specified, a root is automatically determined through ```node.window.getScreen```. This parameter is obviously absent in ```node.widgets.getWidget```.

### Third parameter: Options

This parameter is optional and its properties vary from widget to widget. Some are widget-independent.

The same fieldset object in the example above can also be passed as one of the properties of the ```options``` object in the ```node.widgets.append``` method. In this case, the latter has highest priority, and can override the fieldset settings of the constructor.

```js
	var wall = node.widgets.append('Wall', root_element, {fieldset: false});
```

#### On event property

A standard javascript event listener ('onclick', 'onfocus', 'onblur', 'onchange', 'onsubmit', 'onload', 'onunload', and 'onmouseover') can be passed as parameter and it is added to the root element of the widget.

```js
		var options = {
			onclick: function () {
				// do something
			}
		};
	}
```


## Anatomy of node.widgets.append

Each time ```node.widgets.append``` is executed the following operations are performed:

1. Detect whether it is a string or an object
2. Load it from the collection if it is a string
3. Add it to the collection if it is an object
4. Call the ```init``` method
5. Call the ```append``` method
6. Call the ```listeners``` method (if any)
7. Return a reference to the widget object

## How to write a nodeGame widget

In order to preserve encapsulation, a widget should always be wrapped in a self-executing function.

```js
	(function (exports) {

	  // register a widget to the global collection
		node.widgets.register('myWidget', myWidget);

		function myWidget (options) {
	  		// init
		}

		// More code here

	})();
```

Widgets must define a number of constants describing their expected behavior, version, dependencies and so on.


```js

	// Encapsulated

	myWidget.defaults = {};
	myWidget.defaults.id = 'myWidget';

	myWidget.defaults.fieldset = {
    legend: 'Foo',
    id: 'foo_fieldset',
  };

	myWidget.name = 'my cool Widget';
	myWidget.version = '0.3';
	myWidget.description = 'This widget does cool stuff';

	myWidget.dependencies = {
		JSUS: {}
	};

	function myWidget (options) {
		// init
	}

	// More code here
```

There is a set of methods that a widget *must* implement:

|  **Method**  | **Meaning**                                                                                                                           |
| -------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| init         | Initialize the widget object, after the constructor has been called. This method is called everytime a widget needs to be restarted.  |
| append       | Append the widget to a root element and returns it.                                                                                   |
| getRoot      | Returns a pointer to the HTML root element. This is generally the element which gets highlighted if an error occurs.                  |


Some others are *optional*, and nodeGame adds them, if they are missing.

|  **Method**  | **Meaning**                                                                       |
| -------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| listeners    | Define a battery of nodeGame event listeners. This method is called only once.    |
| getAllValues | If the widgets is storing values, this method is suppose to return them all.      |
| highlight    | Highlight the widget in response to particular events.                            |


## Build

You can create a custom nodegame-window build using the make.js file in the bin directory.

```javascript
node make.js build -a // Full build, about 43Kb minified
node make.js build -w msgbar,visualstate -o mywidgets.js // about 4Kb minified
```
